# Housing-Prices-Machine-Learning-Project
Welcome to my 2nd data science project! 

This project uses the Ames Housing dataset compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. 
It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.

Dataset and full description available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course

# Description

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

# Practice Skills
Creative feature engineering 

Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting
